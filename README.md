🤘 I'm Brandon McMaster, a melody-driven tech maven with a penchant for pushing boundaries. I am a music producer, chef, and now, a proud alumni of Tech Elevator in Columbus, Ohio. My lifelong obsession with technology has led me down the exhilarating path of becoming a .NET developer, with a keen focus on the transformative power of artificial intelligence. 

I believe that tech, philosophy, and theology form a cosmic triad, influencing lives across the globe. My quest for knowledge doesn't stop at code; it spirals into the realms of philosophy and theology, seeking interconnected wisdom. 

When I'm not in front of a screen or a musical instrument, you'll find me diving into books, video games, or deep conversations. My muse and partner-in-crime? My incredible wife of 13 years, who I met while touring with my former band, Sleeping With Sirens.

I've now graduated from Tech Elevator, and I'm stoked to embark on this new chapter as a software developer. I'm here to not just write code but to craft digital symphonies that make a difference. Stick around, the show's just getting started! 🎸🎮💻

## Musician 🎸

Hey music aficionados, if you're into the gritty vibes of '90s hard rock with a splash of guitar-driven theatrics, you're in the right place! 🤟 My musical style is a sonic tapestry, woven from the threads of legendary artists—ranging from the enigmatic allure of Prince to the raw emotions of Kurt Cobain and Layne Staley. But wait, there's more! My love for guitar knows no bounds. My melodies often dance to the riffs inspired by virtuosos like Eddie Van Halen, Dimebag Darrell, and Stevie Ray Vaughan.

Did you know? I kickstarted an internationally acclaimed rock band, Sleeping With Sirens. With multiple major label albums under our belt, the band continues to rock stages and hearts worldwide.
